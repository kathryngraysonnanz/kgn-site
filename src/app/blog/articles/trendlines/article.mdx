# Visualize Trends with the KendoReact Trendlines

*Last Modified: January 8, 2024*

It’s easy to get stuck in the weeds when we’re dealing with a lot of data. Sometimes, we need a new way of looking at things; a way to take a step back and find the big takeaways. That’s what the new [KendoReact Chart Trendlines](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts/chart/elements/trendlines/) are perfect for! 

## What are Trendlines?

Trendlines are a new element that can be optionally added to the Chart component. They provide a visual representation (in the form of an additional line added to the chart) of the trends within the data set. There are two types of Trendlines that can be added: 

- [Linear](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts/chart/elements/trendlines/#toc-linear-trendline): depicting whether a particular quantity is increasing or decreasing over time
    
    ![Linear Average](https://d585tldpucybw.cloudfront.net/sfimages/default-source/.net-maui-scheduler/screenshot-2023-11-20-at-2-58-34-pm.png?sfvrsn=6b6bf852_1g)
    
- [Moving Average](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts/chart/elements/trendlines/#toc-moving-average-trendline): smooths out the variations in the data by averaging all points in a period

## Implementing Trendlines

We can choose between these two options – or add them both to a single chart! Just add a new `ChartSeriesItem`child to the `Chart`component and define the `type` and `for`properties to select which type of Trendline to use and which data to base it on! 

```jsx
<ChartSeriesItem
  type="movingAverageTrendline"
  for="Sales By Quarter"
/>
```

Optionally, we can also change the color, dash type, name, style, and more, which can help set it apart visually if the chart has lots of different content. [Check out the docs](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts/chart/elements/trendlines/#toc-customization) for a complete rundown of every applicable Trendline property! 

## Forecasting with Trendlines

One of the coolest things that Trendlines can do, though, is [create a forecast](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/charts/chart/elements/trendlines/#toc-forecasts) of anticipated results, based on the current dataset. This is perfect for common projects like sales projections or growth forecasts!

To create your own forecasts, add `before`and `after` properties set to the number of desired intervals to your `ChartSeriesItem`.

```jsx
<ChartSeriesItem
  name="Sales Forecast (LINEAR)"
  type="linearTrendline"
  for="Sales By Quarter"
  trendline={{ forecast: { before: 2, after: 5 } }}
/>
```
