Personas have a somewhat mixed reputation: some folks love ‘em, others hate ‘em. This difference in opinion actually stems from the same source: brevity. By nature, a user persona is intended to capture high-level data about a user type into one sheet of skim-able, quickly parseable information. For example, we if we’re creating a meal planning app, we might have a persona for Linda, the busy mom. Personas generally include a photo, an age, an occupation, a short bio, and relevant information about how or why they use the product. It’s important to note that personas aren’t *real* user profiles – they’re fictional characters meant to represent a common user type. By giving them names, backstories, and motivations, we can more easily empathize with them – and talk about them in context during the design and development of the product. 

## Why to Use Personas

Personas are created to represent all the different high-level sub-types of users. How you differentiate them will depend on the purpose of your app. Maybe you have a persona for new vs experienced users, or users focused on one feature type as opposed to another. For our meal planning app, we might add a persona for Steve, the young single professional. By thinking about how a young man living alone might use the app, as opposed to a middle-aged woman with a family, we can more easily identify shortcomings or pain points. “Linda” might not be very tech savvy, while “Steve” is a digital native. “Linda” needs to plan out every meal for the next week, while “Steve” only wants to plan dinners for the next 2 or 3 nights. 

By giving these personas names, it not only helps us to visualize that user type, but it also makes it easy to discuss in meetings. When someone proposes an idea, you can say “I like it, but do you think it would make sense to Linda?”. It’s a great way to introduce a shared language and shorthand for communicating complex ideas – especially with non-UX folks who might not be familiar with all the various industry-specific terms and concepts. Personas are a highly approachable and easily understandable tool for talking about your users.  

When we first sit down to design something, we almost always design for ourselves – it’s just human nature. We imagine what we would want if we were using this app, and that’s our starting point. I’d also say that there’s actually nothing *wrong* with using ourselves as a starting point…as long as it’s not also our ending point. When we think about how different users with different goals and priorities will experience our app, it forces us to get outside our comfort zone and innovate. Personas are a tool for helping us “walk that mile” in someone else’s shoes. We know how the app is *meant* to be used, and often we build products with a very specific end goal in mind. That makes all the sense in the world…until someone wants to do something a little different with what we’ve built. It’s also fair to say “No, that action is outside the scope of what we’re building for” and choose not to support it – but figuring that out, defining those lines and boundaries, is in and of itself a crucial part of the product design process. 

## Potential Pitfalls

The flip side of this – and the part that some folks dislike – is that by nature this process reduces users to stereotypes. As with any kind of shorthand, over-simplification is just part of the process. While that does speed things up and help us talk about users at a high level, it also runs the risk of overlooking your users who *don’t* perfectly fit into those generalizations. Remember, just because a user isn’t in the majority does not mean they are an “edge case”. Furthermore, when personas are created by just one person (or a homogenous group of people), they can unintentionally reflect the subconscious biases of that person or group – just one of many reasons why diverse teams are important. All of this is *especially* risky if there hasn’t been any information-gathering process, first. When teams jump right to creating personas without any actual data to back them up – just their own, unvalidated assumptions about the user – they absolutely won’t reap any of the benefits. For personas to be valuable, they need to reflect real data gathered by talking to real users. 

It’s also worth noting that personas are not a required part of the UX design process. If you think there’s a chance they’ll do more harm than good, or if they just don’t sound particularly worthwhile for your specific project – skip ‘em! There’s no persona police. Personas are simply one of a great many tools you can use to make the challenging task of UX design a little easier. If they’re making things harder, don’t stress it. 

## How to Create Personas

As you might have gathered, the first step to persona creation actually isn’t related to personas, specifically. You need a strong basis of user research that you can draw on to populate those personas – if you don’t have that yet, then that needs to be step number one. 

Once you have that data, it’s time to start looking for patterns. If you notice that most users between the age of 50 and 60 favor one particular feature, express a similar goal, or had something else in common, that’s a good thing to include in a persona for a user in that age group. Other demographics or descriptions you want to include in your personas will probably be dependent on the type of app or website that you’re building. For example, if you’re making a university website, your personas might be for an undergraduate student, graduate student, and parent of a student. Similarly, if you’re making an app for tracking workouts, maybe your personas reflect different common health goals: getting stronger, losing weight, improving flexibility, recovering from an injury, etc. 

There’s no “one-fits-all” template for personas, because (by nature) they need to reflect the different things that are important to your user group. What you’d need to include in the university persona would be *significantly* different than the content in the workout persona. Ask people about their primary goals and tasks within the app, listen to their pain points and challenges, look for recurring information or patterns in your research data, and use that to create customized personas relevant to your specific product. 

### Empathy Mapping

A helpful process that you might want to include in your persona – or just the persona creation process – is empathy mapping. An empathy map is a type of data visualization that’s built based on user research to identify user needs. It has four quadrants: Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels. 

The “Says” section should include (ideally) direct user quotes that you heard people say during interviews, usability testing, focus groups, etc. 

The “Thinks” section is meant to capture things that a user might be thinking but too nervous, embarrassed, or polite to say aloud. Sometimes, we do hear these things when we ask users to think aloud during usability testing, but more often this comes from reading between the lines a little bit – looking to see where what a user says diverges from what they do. 

The “Does” section is for user actions. If we’re watching a user with our software, are they clicking around aimlessly? Do they flip back and forth between two specific pages? If we ran user interviews, how do they describe their job requirements or their day-to-day? 

The “Feels” section is for capturing user feelings. Generally, we derive these just from watching the user during interviews or testing to see if they’re visibly nervous, angry, happy, etc. However, they can also come from direct user quotes (ie: “It was annoying when…”). 

You might find that it’s helpful to include an empathy map as part of the finished persona document – or you might just find that it’s helpful to do an empathy mapping exercise before building out a persona, to get yourself “into their shoes” so to speak. As always, I say the best tools are the ones that fit into your process and feel helpful to you – if empathy mapping (or anything else) isn’t making your work better or your life easier, don’t stress it. 

## Data-Driven Results

When personas are informed by research, they can be powerful tools…but when they’re created based on assumptions or guesses, they can set you back quite a ways. If you choose to use them, they can be helpful for high-level planning and thinking about your product from a different perspective – just make sure you’re drawing from real data and keeping in mind that there will still be some users who aren’t represented.
