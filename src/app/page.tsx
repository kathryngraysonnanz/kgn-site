          <p>
          In 2013, I graduated with a Fine Arts degree and took my first job as Junior Graphic Designer at a small, boutique ad agency in Washington, DC. While there, my Creative Director told me to never let anyone else find out that I knew how to code â€“ he warned me that if they knew I could do it, I&apos;d be stuck doing it forever and never get to focus on print design again. I ignored his warning; turns out, he was completely right, but I&apos;ve never been happier.
          </p>
          <p>
          I currently work as a Senior Design & Developer Advocate at Progress Software where I help people build beautiful and user-friendly interfaces, design and maintain component libraries, and stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS. I&apos;m also a graduate student, in the process of earning a Master&apos;s degree in Software Systems Design and Engineering. I&apos;m especially interested in React, UI design and design systems, accessibility, and creating applications and websites that center the human experience.
