Design is a science-based skill that can be learned by anyone - including you! The &quot;Foundations of Design for Developers&quot; eBook will help you gain a solid grasp of the design fundamentals every engineer needs to know. Many engineers and developers are interested in learning design but discouraged by the mountain of information available.Finish the eBook and you&apos;ll be well-equipped to bridge the gap between design and development, and </p>

                        <p>In an ideal world, usability testing might be considered exclusively the job responsibility of UX designers or researchers. However, for many of us and for various reasons, that just isn&apos;t a reality. No matter what the situation is, running basic usability tests is something everyone is completely capable ofâ€”and it comes with the bonus of making us better at our own jobs, as well, by better understanding our users.</p>
                        <p>In this course, we&apos;ll discuss finding participants, thinking through the testing logistics, writing and facilitating a usability test, and reviewing the data. Each learner will get the chance to write a usability testing script for a feature in their own website or application that they&apos;d like to test. Then, they&apos;ll be challenged to practice usability tests with those scripts to get hands-on experience facilitating tests. Learners will leave this course feeling empowered and confident to start a usability testing program at their own workplace!</p>
